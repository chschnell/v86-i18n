# v86-i18n

Supplementary JavaScript modules for internationalization support in [V86](https://github.com/copy/v86).

This repository provides two modules to add support for US and non-US Copy/Paste functions between the hosting browser and the V86 guest:

* **[codepage-tables](codepage-tables)** for US and non-US support of the **Copy** function
* **[keyboard-tables](keyboard-tables)** for US and non-US support of the **Paste** function

See discussion [Internationalizing Copy and Paste](https://github.com/copy/v86/discussions/1159) for the context of these modules.
